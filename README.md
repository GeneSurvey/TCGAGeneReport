The goal of the Gene Survey project is to take TCGA Standardized Data and make gene level cross-disease and sometimes cross platform comparisons and evaluations simpler to perform, as these represent common questions asked of PIs and analysts. That is, a common question is: how does gene XYZ act across disease types?

This is the R package used for this project. The Java and data packages will be available soon.

This is for educational and research purposes only.
